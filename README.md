## Advanced LaTeX Training

This are the materials for training advanced topics in LaTeX. It was originally designed for the unofficial "Workshop on intermediate and advance topics in LaTeX", so it is expected that you have already head some experiences with LaTeX and thus you do not require elementary guidelines. 

#### Topics covered:
* combining latex documents from pieces
* table of contents and other automatically generated lists
* references and counters
* multipanel figures
* flowcharts and schematics
* dispalying code snippets (including code highlights)
* tables: importing and formatting
* links and their styling
* macros

### Prerequisities

To start with this LaTeX training, you need following:
* LaTeX compiler (editting online on overleaf is also OK)
* PDF viewer

Furthermore, for some of the tasks you also need:
* installed latexdiff

### Guidelines 

To start with the training, 
 * Open [day1latex.tex](./day1latex.tex "day1") and compile (with PdfLatex or some built-in command).
 * All the further instructions for the modification of the latex file are in the compiled document. Follow them.
 * Once you are finished, continue with [day2latex.tex](./day2latex.tex "day 2") and compile. Again, all the further instructions for the modification of the file are in the compiled document. Follow them.

The example of compiled PDFs are located in the folder [compiled](./compiled "folder with compiled pdfs") (Please note that the the compiled pdfs are updated only occasionally.)
