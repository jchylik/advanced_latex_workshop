## LaTeX workshop

This are the files for the LaTeX workshop. It is expected that you have already head some experiences with LaTeX and thus you do not require elementary guidelines.

### Guidelines 

To start with tre training, 
 * Open ["day2latex_v2.tex"](./day2latex_v2.tex "day 2") and compile (with PdfLatex or some built-in command).
 * All the further instructions for the modification of the file are in the compiled document. Follow them.

The example of compiled PDFs are located in the folder [compiled](./compiled "folder with compiled pdfs")
